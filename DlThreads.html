                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is Threads?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">Threads is a new app from the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The platform resembles Twitter, with a feed of mostly text-based posts—though users can also post photos and videos—where people can have real-time conversations.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">How does Threads work?</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">Threads combines the existing aesthetics and navigation system of Instagram and offers the ability to share Threads posts directly to Instagram Stories. Users can post messages with a limit of 500 characters, similar to Twitter. They can reply, forward, and quote other users' topic posts.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Public and Private Accounts</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">Accounts can be listed as public or private. Verified Instagram accounts are automatically verified on Threads.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">How to Sign Up? (And Can You Leave?)</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">Users sign up through their Instagram accounts and keep the same username, password, and account name, although they can edit their bio to be exclusive to Threads. Users can also import their list of followed accounts directly from Instagram, making it super easy to get started with the app. However, leaving Threads is not as easy. While users can temporarily deactivate their profiles through the app's settings section, the company states in its privacy policy that "your Threads profile can only be deleted by deleting your Instagram account."</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Availability</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600">Threads is available in 100 countries and in over 30 languages on iOS and Android, according to the company.</p>
